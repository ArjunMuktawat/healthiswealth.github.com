        <p>Being healthy is about having good physical health and being mentally and socially fit. A healthy person can be more focused, more determined and can lead a happy life.</p>
        <p>If we look into human history, the biggest asset to human beings is good health and a healthy mind.</p>
        <p>Health is the biggest wealth. It helps us to enjoy all the little things in life. If one is not healthy, they fail to feel happy. Being unhappy can impact the health of people around us too. In order to be truly healthy, one must eat well, sleep on time and wake up early.</p>
        <p>Staying fit by exercising daily also helps to keep oneâ€™s health in proper check. If you are in good health, you can always work to attain more wealth. But if one is not healthy, then wealth is of no importance. Hence, we should adopt and work towards a healthy lifestyle.</p>
